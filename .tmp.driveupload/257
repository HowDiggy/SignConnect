<div align="center">
  <h3>Breaking Communication Barriers</h3>
</div>

## Project Overview

SignConnect is an assistive technology web application designed to help deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals navigate everyday conversations with ease. Using speech-to-text technology and AI-powered response suggestions, SignConnect creates a seamless bridge between spoken language and text-based communication.

### The Problem

For deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, spontaneous conversations can be challenging, especially in environments where:
- Communication partners don't know sign language
- Note-passing is impractical or too slow
- Professional interpreters aren't available

### Our Solution

SignConnect transforms spoken language into text in real-time and provides intelligent, contextual response suggestions based on the user's preferences and conversation history.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Speech-to-Text**: Instantly convert spoken words into readable text
- **Context-Aware Response Suggestions**: Get personalized response options based on the conversation context
- **Scenario-Based Support**: Pre-configure responses for common situations like restaurants, medical appointments, or workplace meetings
- **User Preferences**: Store favorites, commonly used phrases, and personal details for quick access
- **Offline Capabilities**: Continue using core features even without internet connectivity
- **Vector-Based Semantic Matching**: Understand the meaning behind questions for more accurate response suggestions

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (Progressive Web App)
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for semantic search
- **Speech Processing**: Web Speech API / OpenAI Whisper API
- **Vector Embeddings**: OpenAI Embeddings API
- **Deployment**: AWS/GCP/Azure (TBD)

### **4. Project Structure (Monorepo)**

We are using a standard monorepo structure that cleanly separates the backend and frontend code.
